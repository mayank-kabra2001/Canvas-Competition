The project is named as carromboard .
As the name suggests it is a visual carromboard made by using canvas file .
Main logic applied in the project is about collision , how collisions are performed , coefficient of restitution , linear momentum conservation .
This project also includes oblique collision , and large no of equations made using two equations i.e. conservation of linear momentum and equation of coefficient of restitution .
